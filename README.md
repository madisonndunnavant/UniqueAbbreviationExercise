# UniqueAbbreviationExercise
This program is a collection of words being abbreviated using a specific method (first letter + number of middle letters + last letter). Then each abbreviation is compared with each other and if the abbreviation is unique, the program will print true. If there are multiple abbreviations that are the same, the program will print false.
